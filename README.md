# Immunet Converter


Small program written in python for small practices and physicians in Maryland to simplify the process of submitting vaccination records to Immunet. 

This makes use of Immunet's CSV file upload system. 

The program splits the input file into two separate files, organizes the columns, adds double quotation marks to each cell, and names the files according to the current date. 

Read the PDF file titled: MD_Immunet_COVID_19_immunization_reporting_protocol.pdf for more detailed instructions.

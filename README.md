This is a small program written in python for small practices and physicians in Maryland to simplify the process of submitting vaccination records to Immunet, making use of Immunet's CSV file upload system. If you are not familar with git, use the three download links at the bottom of this text. NOTE: this program only works for windows computers.

The program splits the input file into two separate files, organizes the columns, adds double quotation marks to each cell, and names the files according to the current date.
